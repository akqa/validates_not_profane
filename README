ValidatesNotProfane
===================

This plugin provides a simple blacklist of profane words, and a
validation against that blacklist. Instead of filtering (like so
many solutions out there), we prevent the record from being created
if it contains foul language in a given field.


Example
=======

Group.rb:

validates_not_profane :name
validates_not_profane :permalink, :label => "URL"

Controller:

Group.create(:name => "Shitty Kids", :permalink => "shitty")


produces these errors:

* Name must not contain any vulgar words
* URL must not contain any vulgar words
