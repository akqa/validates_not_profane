ValidatesNotProfane
===================

This plugin provides a hook into the Profanalyzer gem as a validation
for your ActiveRecord models. It's use is simple:

    validates_not_profane :column_name, :column_2

Will cause the model to produce errors if that column contains profanity
in its value. Of course, since the Profanalyzer gem is customizable, so is
the validation:

    validates_not_profane :post_title, :racist => true, :sexual => false

will block racial slurs, but nothing else.

    validates_not_profane :post_title, :tolerance => 5

will block only the most vile of profanity. The scale for tolerance is
from 0-5, which is mostly subjective, in all honesty.

You can also use the :label option to customize the error message - see
the examples below.


Example
=======

Group.rb:

validates_not_profane :name
validates_not_profane :permalink, :label => "URL"
validates_not_profane :description, :racist => false, :sexual => true

Controller:

Group.create(:name => "Shitty Kids", 
             :permalink => "shitty", 
             :description => "i'm a dumb mick")


produces these errors:

* Name must not contain any vulgar words
* URL must not contain any vulgar words

The description, despite having a racial slur for Irish people in it,
will pass validation. It's as simple as that!
